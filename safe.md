# Is is safe?

We are traveling through the India-controlled (more dangerous) part of Kashmir. With this in mind, we will be following reasonable safety methods. We will be wearing bulletproof vests. We will get [every vaccine that the CDC recommends](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/pakistan?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) beforehand. We are staying exclusively in hotels in populated and major cities and avoiding small towns or desolate areas. For transportation, we will be primarily taking flights but also [hiring a private bodyguard](https://www.lasorsa.com/executive-protection-bodyguard-services/) to drive us and go with us throughout the week. Avoiding police confrontation and following all local laws will be our top priority. With these things in mind, we should be very safe.
