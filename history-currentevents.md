# History & Current Events of Kashmir
Kashmir has been ruled by foreign powers since 1586. Sunni and Shia Muslims both controlled parts of Kashmir but fought often, offering the third Mughal Emperor Akbar (who ruled 1556-1605) the opportunity to invade Kashmir and capture it in 1586. Later, Afghan rulers also abused the division between the Sunni and Shia sects in Kashmir to gain control over the region. Afghan rule was very repressive for the Kashmiris. Sikh rule, starting in 1819, was also repressive because they discriminated against muslims. During the rebellion of 1857, Kashmir sided with the British.

When Britain partitioned India in 1947, all of India became either part of India or the newly created Pakistan. Kashmir did not choose to become part of India or Pakistan because it did not have a clear majority of either Hindus or Muslims. Instead, the monarch of Kashmir was able to choose which country to join. He was conflicted and wanted Kashmir to become an independent state. Later, Kashmir joined India for protection from Pakistani war on the condition that it would be allowed some independence, including the ability to make its own laws.

Currently, Kashmir is a disputed region between India, Pakistan and China). Both India and Pakistan claim ownership of the entire region; however, each country only controls part of it. The Indian-administered part has had more unrest. Kashmir has been the site of constant violence for decades. China controls a mostly uninhabited part on the east, Aksai Chin. The line of control, a 460-mile line, is an unofficial border between India and Pakistan and a cease-fire was agreed upon in 2003. There have been clashes across the border, and in 2018 86 total civilians were killed on the border.

India has recently cracked down on the area by removing its “privileged status” (ability to make laws), supposedly for economic reasons and border security as well as “legislative efficiency”. Before the crackdown, India instituted a communications blackout in Kashmir, stopping internet, mail and other communications. India also stopped a Hindu pilgrimage before the crackdown.

During the crackdown, India has arrested politicians & party members in Kashmir. Tourists have been removed and more than 10 thousand troops have been deployed. Public meetings have been banned in towns. The crackdown is to “restore order”, according to India.

India is planning splitting part of Jammu and Kashmir into a separate region of Ladakh off, with both Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh becoming a union territory and controlled federally.
