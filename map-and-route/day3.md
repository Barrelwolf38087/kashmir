### Anchar neighborhood in Srinagar
![day3](../day3.png)  


We will walk or drive to the neighborhood of Anchar. In the neighborhood of Anchar, Indian armed forces have been forcing residents to house soldiers. Protesting residents have been met with tear gas and pepper spray. Since Srinagar is one of the major cities in Kashmir, will ask the locals what they think of the current situation.
