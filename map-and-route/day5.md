# Day 5
## Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus
![day5](../day5.png)  


Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was a site of 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. The attack was by Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was not endorsed by Pakistan but still a reflection of the tensions between the two countries. We will be visiting the memorial there.
