# Global Response
Pakistan has asked its allies for help and heightened diplomatic tensions with India. India blames Pakistan for backing separatists in Kashmir and causing fights - which Pakistan denies. It has been viewed as an attack on democracy and some of Kashmir’s leaders have viewed it as “illegal and unconstitutional”. Kashmir has been referred to as one of the world’s most militarized zones by human rights organizations.” Police have fired tear gas & pellets at demonstrators.. The prime minister of Pakistan has accused India of increasing a “racist ideology”. The prime minister fears a future “ethnic cleansing” and accused of India removing rights as “Nazi ideology”. India doesn't want trump to mediate in discussion. China doesn't like india’s reorganization. India wants other countries to leave them alone because it is an internal affair. India and Pakistan have both refused peace talks.
