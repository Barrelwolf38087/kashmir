# Lakhanpur Fort
![day2](../day2.png)
We will be flying to the Sri Guru Ram Das airport and then driving to the Lakhanpur fort, which lies almost directly on the border between Jammu and Kashmir and the rest of India. We’re mostly going there to see what it’s like on the border. We will then drive back to the airport and sleep in a hotel near there.
