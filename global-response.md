# Global Response
Pakistan has asked its allies for help and heightened diplomatic tensions with India. India blames Pakistan for backing separatists in Kashmir and causing violence in the area. Kashmiri politicians refer to the removal of Article 370 as an attack on democracy and some of Kashmir’s leaders have viewed it as “illegal and unconstitutional”. Kashmir has been referred to as one of the world’s most militarized zones by human rights organizations. Police have fired tear gas & pellets at demonstrators.. The prime minister of Pakistan claims that the change is motivated by “racist ideology” and fears a future“ethnic cleansing” and called India removing rights “Nazi ideology”. While some have suggested that Trump should mediate in discussion between the two countries, India and Pakistan have opposed peace talks. India opposes most external involvement, claiming that the changes are internal matters. China opposes the reorganization. External humanitarian aid has struggled as India has refused to ask for help from the United Nations and is restrictive with its borders.
